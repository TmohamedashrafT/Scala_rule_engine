![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scala-2.13.x-DC322F?logo=scala&logoColor=white)
![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build-sbt-green.svg)

A high-performance rule engine for applying complex business rules to transaction data, written in pure functional Scala.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Rule Composition**: Combine multiple discount rules with custom logic
- **Dynamic Evaluation**: Rules evaluated at runtime based on transaction attributes
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently process 1,000+ transactions
- **Oracle Integration**: JDBC-based data persistence
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed execution logs for every transaction
- **Pure Functions**: Immutable data structures and side-effect-free logic

## Rule Catalog

| Function Name            | Description                                                                 | Example Application                                                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `calculateExpiryDiscount`| Calculates a discount based on how close the product is to expiration.     | A product expiring in 29 days gets 1% off, expiring in 1 day gets 29% off.      |
| `categoryDiscount`       | Applies a discount for specific product types (cheese or wine).             | "Cheddar Cheese" ‚Üí 10% discount, "Red Wine" ‚Üí 5% discount.                      |
| `march23rdDiscount`      | Applies a special 50% discount for purchases on March 23rd.                 | Any item bought on 23rd March gets 50% off.                                     |
| `quantityDiscount`       | Applies a bulk discount based on how many units are bought.                 | Buying 12 units ‚Üí 7% discount, buying 6 units ‚Üí 5% discount.                    |
| `channelDiscount`        | Applies a discount for app purchases based on quantity (rounded to 5).     | Buying 7 units through app ‚Üí 10% discount, 12 units ‚Üí 15% discount.             |
| `cardDiscount`           | Applies a 5% discount for purchases made using Visa card.                   | Any product purchased with Visa ‚Üí 5% discount.                                  |

**Rule Composition Strategy**: 
Applies the average of the top two eligible discounts per transaction.

## Database Schema
The application expects the following table:

```
CREATE TABLE discounted_transactions (
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  product_name VARCHAR2(100),
  expiry_date DATE,
  quantity NUMBER,
  unit_price NUMBER(10,2),
  channel VARCHAR2(20),
  payment_method VARCHAR2(20),
  discount NUMBER(5,2),
  final_price NUMBER(10,2)
);
```

Logging
The application generates detailed logs in `rules_engine.log`:
```
